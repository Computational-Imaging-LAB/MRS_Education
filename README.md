# MRS Education

# We provide installation guides of LCModel for macOS, Linux and Windows. 
# <h1>Linux </h1> 
**Lets start with the easiest one Linux!**
##
*Firstly open a new terminal. Then copy-paste the commands highlighted below respectively.*

`git clone https://github.com/Computational-Imaging-LAB/MRS_Education.git`

`cd MRS_Education`

`bash manual-install`

*There will be a LCModel GUI pop-upped*

Then exit from that GUI after showing the plots.

We will set up PATH variable to reach lcmgui anywhere we want! Cool huh?

`PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.lcmodel/"`

Yoowwza! Everything is all set-up.
Now you can easily call lcmgui

`lcmgui`


# <h1>Windows </h1>

*There are two ways to install on Windows. If you are lazy -as me- you can use windows-install.bat file to install virtualbox and other things without harming your comfort.*
*The second way is to downloading all the required tools by yourself manually.*
